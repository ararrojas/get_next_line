The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing 
to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, 
square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives 
and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing -for the use of hosepipes had been banned 
due to drought. Deprived of their usual carwashing and lawnmowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive 
had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, 
windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. 
The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.
